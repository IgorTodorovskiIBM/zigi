+
+The use of PDSE Member Generations can provide additional recovery
+capabilities as it allows access to previous versions, up to the generation
+limit defined for the PDSE. However, to access a generation requires the use
+of a generations enabled application.
+
+Among the generation enabled applications are:
+   - PDSEGEN (free - www.lbdsoftware.com)    - File Manager (IBM)
+   - Data Set Commander (IBM)                - File-Aid (Compuware)
+   - EzyEdit (Broadcom)                      - PDSMAN  (Broadcom)
+   - SimpList (MacKinney Systems)
+
+Note: Generations may not be accessed from JCL or Dynamic Allocation.
