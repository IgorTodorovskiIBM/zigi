                               %Starting zigi
+
+Starting%zigi+is easy. If the sample startup stub has been installed then all
+that is required is to issue the command%TSO zigi+from any ISPF panel.
+
+If the bypass option on the splash panel has been enabled (using Y) and you
+wish to see the splash panel again, then the command would be %TSO zigi S+to
%start zigi.
+
+If you know the name of a specific repository you want to start with then
+the command would be%TSO zigi repository-name+and zigi opens that
+repository and bypasses the Local Repository table.
