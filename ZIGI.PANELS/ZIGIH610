+ All z/OS datasets have a copy that resides in the OMVS repository directory.
+
+ To translate a z/OS dataset to an OMVS directory or file name:
+
+ 1. Remove from the dataset name any qualifiers that are to be ignored.
+    e.g. For APP.DEV.PRODUCTX.C remove the 1st two qualifiers
+         so the OMVS directory would be PRODUCTX.C
+ 2. Some special characters can present problems in OMVS that are acceptable
+    in z/OS:
+      The characters that are         OMVS   z/OS
+      translated are the%@#$+        %  _+<->%@
+      and are converted to%_.-+      %  .+<->%#
+      and back.                      %  -+<->%$
+  3. A .gitattributes file must also exist in the root directory for the
+     respository. To make it easy just create a dummy repository using zigi
+     and copy the .gitattributes from there - then delete the dummy repo.
