                        %Keyboard and Mouse Navigation
+
+The zigi application has been designed to support both the traditional
+ISPF Panel navigation by entering the desired commands and table row
+selections. It has also been designed to support%point-and-shoot+fields
+for use by those more comfortable with that approach.
+
+Enabling%Tab to point-and-shoot fields+in the ISPF Settings (option 0 on
+the ISPF Primary Menu) will make these fields easier to use with both the
+keyboard and mouse.
+
+Use the keyboard tab key, or newline key, to move to the point and shoot fields
+and then just press the%Enter+key to execute that command or table row
+selection.
+
+Or move the mouse pointer to the command or row and double left click.
+
+
           +Press the%Enter+key to begin your zigi tutorial journey.
