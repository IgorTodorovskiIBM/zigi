+
%zigi+is designed to provide an easy to use ISPF interface to local, and
+remote, git repositories. It is%not+designed to be a full application
+development environment - there are better tools for that available in native
+ISPF to open source ISPF tool, and vendor tools.
+
%zigi+is however designed to make it easy to be the easy interface to git for
+source code version control for your application development team.
+
+It is recommended that each team working with%zigi+develop a plan on how to
+use it. This is no different from the plan  on how teams are to use any SCM.
