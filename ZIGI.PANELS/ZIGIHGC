+
+The git command panel supports entering any git command to be executed with
+the results displayed using ISPF Browse. All commands will be executed in the
+directory of the local repository.
+
+The first command does not require%git+to be specified. Additional command may
+be entered using%&&+as a separator and will require%git+to be coded. Here is
+an example with a git log command followed by a git status command:
+
   +Enter any git command (without git):
   %git@log --cc -m -n 10 && git status
+
+All commands will be saved in a command history table, with the most recent on
+top. Use these line commands with the table rows:
+
   %S+to select and place it in the git command field for editing
   %D+to delete a command from the table. Multiple rows may be selected for%D+
   %X+to execute the command and place it into the command entry field
+
+Press%Enter+to execute the command after entering or editing it.
