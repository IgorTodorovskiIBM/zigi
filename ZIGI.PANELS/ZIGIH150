+
+The%Basic Menu+and%Pro+commands are actually toggle commands to change the
+panels where they are used to, or from, a verbose description of the available
+commands on those panels.
+
+The%Pro+version is very terse and is ideal for those who want more space on the
+panel for other things. Even when in%Pro+mode it is easy to find out what the
+commands are by using%F1+to view the tutorial panel.
+
+The%Basic+version is more verbose and is ideal for those learning%zigi+for the
+first time.
+
+The 3rd toggle will remove both the command and row selection menus for a very
+terse panel providing more room for actual data.
