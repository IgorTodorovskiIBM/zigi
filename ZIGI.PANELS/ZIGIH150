+
+Both%PRO+and%BASIC+commands are actually toggle commands to change the panels
+where they are used to, or from, a verbose description of the available
+commands on those panels.
%
The%Pro+version is very terse and is ideal for those who want more space on the
+panel for other things. Even when in%Pro+mode it is easy to find out what the
+commands are by using%F1+to view the tutorial panel.
+
The%Basic+version is more verbose and is ideal for those learning%zigi+for the
+first time.
