+Converting a non-zigi managed repository for use by zigi is a manual process
+since every repository is different:
+
   1. Get into OMVS
   2. Create subdirectories for each respective z/OS PDS
+     (e.g. all c source into directory c)
+  3. Move all files into their respective directories and remove any
+     file suffix
+  4. Rename any sequential files in the repository root that are z/OS
+     datasets to upper case using standard z/OS naming conventions
+     - the file name should not include any high-level-qualifier
+  5. Execute the%CONVREPO+command to convert the repo
+
%Notes:+ 1. The .gitattributes file was created by zigi
+        2. The .zigi subdirectory was created by zigi
+        3. The .zigi/dsn file was created by zigi
+        4. A git add . was performed by zigi
