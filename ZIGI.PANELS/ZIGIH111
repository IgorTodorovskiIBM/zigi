+
+Notes:
+
+1. Your SSH Key%must+have been added to an account with access to the repo.
+2. Clone fails if the local repo already exists.
+3. A successful clone results in a copy of the repo in the local directory
+4. All 'z/OS-datasets' from this repo will be copied to real z/OS datasets
+   (prefixed if a PREFIX has been added).
+5. This%will+overwrite any members if the dataset already exists
+
+The Clone operation creates the instance of the repository.  It
+not only checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete
+repository. Users can perform many operations with this local repository.
+The only time networking gets involved is when the repository instances are
+being synchronized.
