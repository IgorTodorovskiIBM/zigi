+
%Tag+will prompt for a tag identifier and an optional tag description
+and then apply the tag to the current repository. The tag will also
+be pushed to the remote repository.
+
+Tag assigns a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository.
+Tags are very similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are
+immutable. It means, tag is a branch, which nobody intends to modify.
+Once a tag is created for a particular commit, even if you create a new
+commit, it will not be updated. Usually, developers create tags for
+product releases.
